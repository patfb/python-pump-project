1. On boot open terminal and run python script
2. Look for pump turning on
3. Mark which pump is running
4. Run timer until pump stops
5. Find data file and open
6. Mark data and put in file - with which pump and time it ran and date
7. Close file

10. Get rid of data on Pi after certain time but not from google

Practice:
Opening file and writing data in it
Use the keyboard as the pump
"z = pump 1 turning on"
Writing code for a timer/finding it online
Writing data to file
Figuring out how to load data into google sheet
(then possibly deleting data off of pi)
